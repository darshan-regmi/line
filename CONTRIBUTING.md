# Contributing to line

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Line is a poetry-first social app for iOS, Android and web, built with React Native and Expo on Firebase.

> **`main` is protected.** Every change lands through a pull request. Direct
> pushes, force-pushes and branch deletion are blocked for everyone except the
> maintainer. If you have write access, work on a branch and open a PR — please
> don't merge your own.

## Workflow

1. Start from an up-to-date `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git switch -c feat/short-description origin/main
   ```

2. Make your change and commit it (see [Commit style](#commit-style)).
3. Push the branch and open a PR against `main`:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/short-description
   ```

4. A maintainer reviews and merges.

If you already committed to your local `main`, move the work to a branch:

```bash
git switch -c feat/my-change
git branch -f main origin/main
```

## Local setup

Node.js 20+, npm and Expo Go (or a simulator).

```bash
npm install
npm start          # Expo dev server
npm run ios        # or: npm run android / npm run web
```

## Checks

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

## Commit style

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`,
`docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Keep the subject imperative and under
~72 characters; put the "why" in the body.

Branch names: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `refactor/…`.

## Guidelines

- Keep each PR focused on one change; split unrelated work.
- Don't reformat or rename untouched code — it makes review harder.
- Add or update documentation when behaviour changes.
- **Never commit secrets** (`.env`, API keys, service-account JSON, tokens).
  Use the example env files and your own local values.
- Match the existing style and structure of the codebase.
- Dark mode is the primary theme; check both themes when you touch UI.
- Respect accessibility: 48px minimum touch targets and sufficient contrast.
- Memoise expensive work (`useMemo`/`useCallback`) and paginate Firestore queries.
- Keep components under roughly 300 lines.

## Reporting issues
